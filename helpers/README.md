# Helpers

Scripts for maintaining mod data. Run with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Update-CharaNames.py

Pulls character texture IDs and names from the [community Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/177M1Uro7EtHebWKhYr8-P4D62jLuhEl7JLCVHirWFbE) and generates `SparkingZeroAccess/chara_names.lua` — the lookup table that maps texture IDs to display names and DP costs.

```bash
uv run helpers/Update-CharaNames.py
```

Run this when new characters are added to the game (DLC) or when the community sheet is updated.

## build_dp_table.py

Standalone DP cost table used as a data source by Update-CharaNames.py. Contains manually maintained DP values from ScreenRant and Fandom wiki sources.

```bash
uv run helpers/build_dp_table.py
```
